     * [X] Simple toggling between [ ] and [X].

Parent items should change when their child items change. If not, use
|vimwiki_glr|. The symbol between [ ] depends on the percentage of toggled
child items (see also |g:vimwiki_listsyms|): >
    [ ] -- 0%
    [.] -- 1-33%
    [o] -- 34-66%
    [O] -- 67-99%
    [X] -- 100%
